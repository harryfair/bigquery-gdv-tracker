# BigQuery Database Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary
Your GDV BigQuery database effectively tracks digital advertising campaigns but has several opportunities for improvement. This plan provides specific, actionable recommendations organized by priority and timeline.

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Data Type Inconsistency (HIGH PRIORITY) âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: `project_id` is INTEGER in some tables and STRING in others, causing join failures.
**Status**: FIXED on July 18, 2025
- All tables now use INTEGER for project_id
- Empty strings and 'Project' text converted to NULL
- All joins working correctly

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create backup tables
CREATE TABLE gdv.campaign_meta_backup AS SELECT * FROM gdv.campaign_meta;
CREATE TABLE gdv.adname_detail_backup AS SELECT * FROM gdv.adname-detail;

-- Step 2: Create new tables with consistent schema
CREATE TABLE gdv.campaign_meta_new AS
SELECT 
  short_url,
  CAST(project_id AS STRING) AS project_id,
  project_name,
  ngo,
  issue,
  SQUAD,
  dm,
  content,
  visual,
  isu,
  priority,
  grade,
  status,
  tag,
  create_date,
  optimized_date
FROM gdv.campaign_meta;

-- Step 3: Rename tables
DROP TABLE gdv.campaign_meta;
ALTER TABLE gdv.campaign_meta_new RENAME TO campaign_meta;
```

### 2. Missing Campaign Metadata (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Many campaigns in gdv-daily don't have corresponding campaign_meta records.

**Detection Query**:
```sql
-- Find orphaned campaigns
WITH orphaned_campaigns AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    gd.short_url,
    gd.project_name,
    MIN(gd.date) as first_seen,
    MAX(gd.date) as last_seen,
    COUNT(DISTINCT gd.date) as days_active,
    SUM(gd.cost) as total_cost,
    SUM(gd.gdv_ads) as total_gdv
  FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily` gd
  LEFT JOIN `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.campaign_meta` cm
    ON gd.short_url = cm.short_url
  WHERE cm.short_url IS NULL
    AND gd.date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  GROUP BY 1,2
  HAVING total_cost > 0
)
SELECT * FROM orphaned_campaigns
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Insert missing campaigns into campaign_meta
INSERT INTO `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.campaign_meta` 
(short_url, project_name, SQUAD, dm, content, visual, isu, status, create_date)
SELECT DISTINCT
  gd.short_url,
  gd.project_name,
  gd.SQUAD,
  COALESCE(gd.dm, 'UNASSIGNED'),
  COALESCE(gd.content, 'UNASSIGNED'),
  COALESCE(gd.visual, 'UNASSIGNED'),
  COALESCE(gd.isu, 'UNASSIGNED'),
  'RETROACTIVE',
  MIN(gd.date) as create_date
FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily` gd
LEFT JOIN `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.campaign_meta` cm
  ON gd.short_url = cm.short_url
WHERE cm.short_url IS NULL
  AND gd.cost > 0
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8;
```

### 3. NULL Values in Critical Fields (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Many records have NULL values in team assignment fields.

**Analysis Query**:
```sql
-- Analyze NULL patterns
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  SUM(CASE WHEN dm IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_dm,
  SUM(CASE WHEN content IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_content,
  SUM(CASE WHEN visual IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_visual,
  SUM(CASE WHEN isu IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_isu,
  SUM(CASE WHEN SQUAD IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_squad
FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily`
WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Create a data quality view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.v_gdv_daily_clean` AS
SELECT 
  short_url,
  date,
  project_name,
  COALESCE(ngo, 'UNSPECIFIED') as ngo,
  COALESCE(SQUAD, 'UNASSIGNED') as SQUAD,
  COALESCE(dm, 'UNASSIGNED') as dm,
  COALESCE(content, 'UNASSIGNED') as content,
  COALESCE(visual, 'UNASSIGNED') as visual,
  COALESCE(isu, 'UNASSIGNED') as isu,
  cost,
  impressions,
  link_clicks,
  website_purchases,
  trx,
  trx_ads,
  gdv,
  gdv_ads,
  ads_donasi,
  `% gdv ads`
FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily`;
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Add Partitioning to More Tables
```sql
-- Partition adname-detail by date
CREATE TABLE `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.adname_detail_partitioned`
PARTITION BY date
CLUSTER BY short_url, project_id AS
SELECT * FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.adname-detail`;

-- Replace original table
DROP TABLE `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.adname-detail`;
ALTER TABLE `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.adname_detail_partitioned` 
RENAME TO `adname-detail`;
```

### 2. Create Materialized Views for Common Queries
```sql
-- Daily performance summary
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.mv_daily_performance`
PARTITION BY date
CLUSTER BY SQUAD AS
SELECT 
  date,
  SQUAD,
  COUNT(DISTINCT short_url) as active_campaigns,
  SUM(cost) as total_cost,
  SUM(impressions) as total_impressions,
  SUM(link_clicks) as total_clicks,
  SUM(website_purchases) as total_conversions,
  SUM(gdv_ads) as total_gdv_ads,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(link_clicks), SUM(impressions)) as avg_ctr,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(website_purchases), SUM(link_clicks)) as avg_cvr,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(cost), SUM(gdv_ads)) as avg_roi
FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily`
WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
GROUP BY 1,2;

-- Campaign performance summary
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.mv_campaign_performance`
CLUSTER BY short_url AS
SELECT 
  cm.short_url,
  cm.project_name,
  cm.SQUAD,
  cm.status,
  cm.priority,
  cm.create_date,
  MIN(gd.date) as first_active_date,
  MAX(gd.date) as last_active_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT gd.date) as days_active,
  SUM(gd.cost) as lifetime_cost,
  SUM(gd.gdv_ads) as lifetime_gdv,
  AVG(gd.ads_donasi) as avg_roi,
  SUM(gd.impressions) as lifetime_impressions,
  SUM(gd.link_clicks) as lifetime_clicks
FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.campaign_meta` cm
LEFT JOIN `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily` gd
  ON cm.short_url = gd.short_url
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6;
```

## Data Quality Monitoring

### 1. Create Monitoring Tables
```sql
-- Data quality metrics table
CREATE TABLE `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.data_quality_metrics` (
  check_date DATE,
  table_name STRING,
  metric_name STRING,
  metric_value FLOAT64,
  threshold_value FLOAT64,
  is_alert BOOLEAN,
  details STRING
)
PARTITION BY check_date;

-- Create scheduled query for daily monitoring
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.sp_daily_data_quality_check`()
BEGIN
  -- Check data freshness
  INSERT INTO `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.data_quality_metrics`
  SELECT 
    CURRENT_DATE() as check_date,
    'gdv-daily' as table_name,
    'data_freshness_days' as metric_name,
    DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), MAX(date), DAY) as metric_value,
    1 as threshold_value,
    DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), MAX(date), DAY) > 1 as is_alert,
    CONCAT('Latest date: ', CAST(MAX(date) AS STRING)) as details
  FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily`;

  -- Check NULL values
  INSERT INTO `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.data_quality_metrics`
  SELECT 
    CURRENT_DATE() as check_date,
    'gdv-daily' as table_name,
    'null_percentage_critical_fields' as metric_name,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN dm IS NULL OR content IS NULL OR SQUAD IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as metric_value,
    10 as threshold_value,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN dm IS NULL OR content IS NULL OR SQUAD IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) > 10 as is_alert,
    'Checking dm, content, SQUAD fields' as details
  FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily`
  WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);

  -- Check for duplicate records
  INSERT INTO `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.data_quality_metrics`
  WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT 
      short_url, 
      date, 
      COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
    FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.gdv-daily`
    WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
    GROUP BY 1,2
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  )
  SELECT 
    CURRENT_DATE() as check_date,
    'gdv-daily' as table_name,
    'duplicate_records' as metric_name,
    COUNT(*) as metric_value,
    0 as threshold_value,
    COUNT(*) > 0 as is_alert,
    CONCAT('Found ', CAST(COUNT(*) AS STRING), ' duplicate key combinations') as details
  FROM duplicates;
END;
```

### 2. Create Alert Views
```sql
-- Active alerts view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.v_active_data_quality_alerts` AS
SELECT 
  check_date,
  table_name,
  metric_name,
  metric_value,
  threshold_value,
  details
FROM `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.data_quality_metrics`
WHERE is_alert = TRUE
  AND check_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
ORDER BY check_date DESC, table_name, metric_name;
```

## Operational Excellence

### 1. Create Documentation Tables
```sql
-- Table documentation
CREATE TABLE `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.table_documentation` (
  table_name STRING,
  column_name STRING,
  data_type STRING,
  is_nullable BOOLEAN,
  description STRING,
  business_rules STRING,
  example_values STRING,
  last_updated DATE
);

-- Insert documentation
INSERT INTO `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.table_documentation` VALUES
('campaign_meta', 'short_url', 'STRING', FALSE, 'Primary campaign identifier', 'Must be unique, format: xxx-xxx-xxx', 'abc-def-ghi', CURRENT_DATE()),
('campaign_meta', 'SQUAD', 'STRING', TRUE, 'Team assignment', 'Values: AREA 1, AREA 2, HOSPITAL, INBOUND', 'AREA 1', CURRENT_DATE()),
('gdv-daily', 'ads_donasi', 'FLOAT64', TRUE, 'ROI metric', 'Calculated as cost/gdv_ads, lower is better', '0.15', CURRENT_DATE());
```

### 2. Create Helper Functions
```sql
-- ROI calculation function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.calculate_roi`(cost INT64, gdv_ads INT64)
RETURNS FLOAT64
AS (
  SAFE_DIVIDE(CAST(cost AS FLOAT64), CAST(gdv_ads AS FLOAT64))
);

-- Performance grade function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `numeric-button-449507-v7.gdv.get_performance_grade`(roi FLOAT64)
RETURNS STRING
AS (
  CASE 
    WHEN roi IS NULL THEN 'NO_DATA'
    WHEN roi <= 0.10 THEN 'EXCELLENT'
    WHEN roi <= 0.15 THEN 'GOOD'
    WHEN roi <= 0.20 THEN 'AVERAGE'
    WHEN roi <= 0.30 THEN 'POOR'
    ELSE 'CRITICAL'
  END
);
```
